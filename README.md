# Keras: GitHub and StackOverflow Issues Analysis

This repo contains code required to perform keyword extraction on Keras GitHub issues.

### Issues Analysis
This is a bucketization of issues into high-level categories. Ideally, these broad themes would be used to improve documentation and error messages for the API itself.

### Installation Woes
Deep dive into common installation issues - based on language (Python, R), operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac), corresponding deep learning framework (Theano, Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow), or development environment (RStudio, Anaconda).

### Usability Enhancements 
Several ideas for improving usability for TensorFlow and Keras

### Keyword Extraction from GitHub Issues
* `keyword_extractor.py`: script for extracting keywords from dumped GitHub issues
* `RAKE_output.csv`: keywords for body content
* `title_ouput.csv`: keywords for titles
* `keras_issues.csv`: full export of issues (June 2018)
