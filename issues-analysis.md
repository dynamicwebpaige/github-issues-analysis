# Keras Issues

-----------------------------------------------------

### How do I create custom loss or activation functions, or constraints?

### How can I ensure my model is reproducible?

### How do I use multiple tensor inputs (especially multiple tensor inputs with differing dimensions)?

### How can I do transfer learning (use pre-trained models) with Keras?

### How can I save some of my Keras layers to use in a new model?

### How can I visualize my Keras models in TensorBoard?

### I am experiencing an issue when working with multiple CPUs / GPUs.

###I am experiencing issues with non-TensorFlow backend (CNTK, Theano).

### I need clarification on how to build and configure an LSTM model.
