# Keras Issues

-----------------------------------------------------

### How do I create custom loss or activation functions, or constraints?

### How can I ensure my model is reproducible?

### How do I use multiple tensor inputs (especially multiple tensor inputs with differing dimensions)?

### How can I do transfer learning (use pre-trained models) with Keras?

### How can I save some of my Keras layers to use in a new model?

### How can I visualize my Keras models in TensorBoard?

### I am experiencing an issue when working with multiple CPUs / GPUs.

### I am experiencing issues with non-TensorFlow backend (CNTK, Theano).

### I need clarification on how to build and configure an LSTM model.

### Troubleshooting for issues with loss and accuracy.

### Troubleshooting errors for input and output dimensions.

* [Issue with input dimensions: `batch_input_shape`, `Conv1D`.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50809155/keras-convolution1d-input-shape)

### Troubleshooting installation and virtual environment issues.
